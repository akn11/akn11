# Ashwin Nambissan's User Page

My name is Ashwin and I am a fourth year *Computer Engineering* major at UCSD. A quicker summary of me can be found in my [README.md](README.md). I am intrested in software devlopment, and after graduating, I would love to work as one in the industry. Some of my favorite programing languages include
1. C++
2. Java
3. Python

These are the languages I have been using the longest. 
Other than that, some other concepts I am intrested in are

- Recomender Systems
- Artificial Intelligence
- Security

Outside of school, I have intrened at Johns Hopkins University's [Applied Phsyics Labroatory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/).

![APL](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQFVygtQGU-lIA/company-logo_200_200/0/1547222461193?e=2159024400&v=beta&t=X0jpJxLZDzjmITesmkfhdmtFKH5SrIKrMLqc7uDpoVE)

I saw this practice used a lot at APL
```
git add
git commit
```
and never really knew how to do it.... until know!

Some facts about me outside of school is that I am a big sports fan. My teams are the 49ers and Warriors. 
>Klay Thompson is one of my favorite players of all time.

As a Warriors fan, I was fortunate enough to see the warriors win (a lot) but now, I really want to see the Niners win one too. We got most of it figured out.
- [x] Defense
- [X] O-Line
- [ ] QB

I'm hoping that within 5 years we can get a ring.
